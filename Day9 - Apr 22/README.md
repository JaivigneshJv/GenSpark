# Hotel Booking System

## Objective
Develop a console-based hotel booking system to enable guests to book rooms, manage reservations, and access hotel services easily.

## Implementation

The system is divided into four layers:

1. **Model Library (HotelBookingSystemModelLibrary)**: This layer contains the data models for `Room`, `Reservation`, and `Guest`.

2. **Data Access Layer (HotelBookingSystemDALLibrary)**: This layer contains repositories for all the entities. It interacts with the database and performs CRUD operations.

3. **Business Logic Layer (HotelBookingSystemBLLibrary)**: This layer contains the business logic of the application. It interacts with the DAL and transforms data to and from the Models.

4. **Console Application (HotelBookingSystem)**: This is the entry point of the application. It interacts with the BLL and presents data to the user.

The system also demonstrates various programming concepts like polymorphism, function overloading, function overriding, class, structure, enum, records, abstract class, indexers, jagged array, exception handling, and custom exception.

## Functional Requirements

### Room Inventory Management
Maintain a comprehensive inventory of available rooms, including details such as room type (e.g., single, double, suite), features (e.g., air conditioning, Wi-Fi, ocean view), occupancy capacity, and nightly rate.

### Reservation Processing
Enable guests to search for available rooms based on their desired check-in and check-out dates, room type, and occupancy needs. Allow guests to book rooms, providing personal details, specific preference. Generate reservation confirmations that include reservation details, total cost, and cancellation policies.

### Guest Management
Maintain records of guests including contact details, reservation history, and preferences. Implement functionality for guests to view their reservation details, modify bookings, or cancel reservations.
