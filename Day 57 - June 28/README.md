### 1. Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental and advanced Python programming concepts. It is designed for beginners to intermediate learners who are looking to enhance their understanding of Python programming and problem-solving techniques.

### 2. Topics Covered

#### String Manipulation

Learn various techniques to manipulate strings, including concatenation, slicing, formatting, and common string methods. These skills are essential for handling text data effectively.

#### Functions

Understand how to define and use functions, pass parameters, and return values. Functions are fundamental building blocks in Python that help in organizing code into reusable pieces.

#### Tuples

Explore tuples, which are immutable sequences in Python. Learn how to create, access, and manipulate tuples, and understand their use cases compared to lists.

#### Dictionaries

Discover dictionaries, a powerful data structure that stores key-value pairs. Learn how to create, access, update, and delete elements in dictionaries, as well as iterate over them.

#### Sets

Understand sets, an unordered collection of unique elements. Learn set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, which are useful for mathematical and logical operations.

### Advanced Problems

1. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

   Solve the problem of finding the longest substring in a given string that does not contain any repeating characters. This enhances string manipulation and algorithmic skills.

2. **Print the List of Prime Numbers Up to a Given Number**

   Write a program to generate and print all prime numbers up to a specified limit. This problem reinforces loops, conditionals, and basic number theory.

3. **Sort Score and Name of Players, Print the Top 10**

   Implement a solution to sort a list of players based on their scores and print the top 10 players. This involves understanding sorting algorithms and data structure manipulation.

4. **Cow and Bull Game (Wordle-like)**

   Create an application to play the Cow and Bull game, maintaining a score for the player. This project involves handling user input, implementing game logic, and maintaining state.

5. **Credit Card Validation - Luhn Check Algorithm**

   Implement the Luhn algorithm to validate credit card numbers. This problem involves understanding and applying a mathematical algorithm to real-world data validation.
