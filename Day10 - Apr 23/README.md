## Getting Started

To get started with the Clinic Management Solution, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/clinic-management.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the application: `npm start`

## Unit Testing

The Clinic Management Solution includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the system. These tests cover all the methods in the business logic layer, ensuring that each function works as expected under various conditions.

The unit tests are designed to cover three main scenarios:

1. **Pass:** These tests verify that the function behaves as expected under normal conditions. For example, when adding a new doctor, the test would confirm that the doctor is correctly added to the database.

2. **Fail:** These tests check how the function behaves when given invalid input or when something goes wrong. For example, trying to schedule an appointment for a non-existent doctor should fail.

3. **Exception:** These tests ensure that the function correctly handles unexpected situations that could lead to exceptions. For example, the system should handle database connection issues gracefully.

The unit tests are written using a testing framework, which provides useful features like test grouping, setup and teardown methods, and assertion functions. This makes the tests easier to write, read, and maintain.
