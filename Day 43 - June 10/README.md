# Simple Banking System Frontend

## Overview

This project is the frontend for the Simple Banking System, a web-based application built using Figma for designing the user interface. It provides a user-friendly interface for the backend API, which offers essential banking functionalities such as user management, account management, transaction management, and loan management.

The backend API for this project is built using ASP.NET Core Web API for creating RESTful services. It uses Entity Framework Core for data management, a Service layer for business logic, and incorporates JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. API documentation can be created through Swagger and Postman.

## Design

The design of the application is done using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/9SM8gxJjySlck8665U5Cln/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=0hefPrGlUm0AtXlv-1). The design includes the following pages:

- User Registration/Login
- User Profile
- Account Management
- Transaction Management

Each page is designed keeping in mind the user experience and the functionalities provided by the backend API.
